# [bsky](https://bsky.app/)-click-and-save
Quick made minimal version.

---

Here is the **MINIMAL** usable version for Bluesky **image** downloading made in 1 hour.

Right click (the context menu event) on the image to download it.

Is the script usable and useful? Yes.

Can it be done better? Of course. Maybe later.

### To install click on the link:
- https://github.com/AlttiRi/bsky-click-and-save/raw/refs/heads/master/bsky-click-and-save.user.js

### Note

- `/post/` URLs are not supported (an opened post), only timeline URLs (`/profile/`, `/search?=`, "Home" page).

- After opening an image spoiler await for 1.2 seconds until the script is handled the image.


  _(Yeah, I just need to use `MutationObserver` to fix it.)_
